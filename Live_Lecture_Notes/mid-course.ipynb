    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "*In this section I'll ask you to fill in some data. You don't have to give precise numbers -- approximate, conversational responses are fine. For example, when I ask \"how often have you attended class,\" good answers include \"almost always,\" \"I've missed three times,\" \"about 75% of the time,\" \"not as often as I want,\" etc.* \n",
    "\n",
    "### Presence in Class\n",
    "\n",
    "- *How often have you attended class?* \n",
    "I missed 2 times\n",
    "- *How often have you taken notes on the core readings ahead of the class period?* I took some notes on paper, but I didn't note them down in the shared doc online, so not as often as I want. \n",
    "- *How often have you been **prepared** to present the daily warm-up exercise to your team, even if you weren't actually called?* I am prepared most of the times, except 2 or 3 times I didn't have time to finish the exercise.\n",
    "- *How many times have you **actually** presented the daily warm-up to your team?* I presented once or twice. \n",
    "- *How many times have you asked your team for help while presenting the daily warm-up?* Once or twice.\n",
    "- *How often have you learned something new from a teammate's presentation of the daily warm-up?* 2 or 3 times.\n",
    "- *How often have you helped a teammate during the daily warm-up presentation?* 1 or 2 times. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Presence Outside of Class \n",
    "\n",
    "- *How often have you attended Student Hours or Peer Help?* I attended Student hours whenever I can, meaning as long as I do not have a scheduling conflict, I would show up. But my math research project meeting is often scheduled the same time as Student Hours. I attended Peer Help every week, I stayed the entire session most of the times, and I like get my work done during those hours.\n",
    "- *How often have you asked for or received help from your fellow students?* I get some form of help regarding my code amost every week.\n",
    "- *Have you been regularly participating in a study group outside class?* No. I work together with several people in the class during Peer Help, but everytime there's usually different people each night. \n",
    "- *How often have you posted questions or answers in Slack?* Only a very few times. \n",

    "I chose to focus on Implementation and I also care about the theory, but the main goal for me is to become a better coder, since I am not very good at implement concepts or mathematical deductions into code, and this has always been something I am not super good at through out my college years. Hence, I very aggressively learn how to implement things and get assignments done (I mean the part with code), and I have pushed myself hard to make progress, and I also cope with the stress that's accompanying debugging, so at this sixth week mark, I think I have served myself well in pursuing my interest. I also learn the theory, which is the math behind the code, so that I implement algorithms correctly. I also strive to reflect on equality, bias, justice in my blog posts analysis, since these human aspects of the problem are sometimes overlooked by technical solutions. \n",

I would like to allow myself to spend less time on writing out the details in a blog post, so that I could concentrate on implementation, and I would still consider myself successful in this course with less polished blog posts."

I haven't finished the write-ups, but $80$ percent of the implementation is done. At this point in the semester, I have pressures from multiple classes (I am taking 5 classes), and I also need to decide by April 15th which grad school to attend for math PhD starting in fall 2023.  The process is going to be ugly, since some grad program director(s) have commmunicated to me that they are going to make some additional offers for people on the waitlist after April 15th. And technically, I should commit to one school by April 15th. Hence, this process is likely consume some of my time and increase my anxiety overall. Hence, I would like to continute to focus on implementation, and I would still consider myself successful if do not have polished paragraphs in my posts."

Originally we discussed a project that apply machine learning to American Options, but it turns out to be too hard given that we have about 6 weeks left in the semester. Then we are thinking about doing natural language processing on scanned historical economics records, for example, farm records that record how many livestocks, grains, milk, oats, etc that farms in 1880s produced. Prateek and I have decided to use data from Chronicling America Library of Congress."

It's competitive, and I consciously learn more computer science whenever I can, so that if I cannot jump the hurdle like getting a academic job, I could still find a industry job, so I have something to fall back on. During CS0451, I also learned some git and terminal commands, and because my current laptop is slow, I have spent some time installing Arch Linux on another laptop (with a better keyboard!!). Hopefully if I managed learn enough linux stuff to configure it correctly , I could use that laptop and have a better workflow because it runs linux (or it's just the keyboard!!)."

    "I didn't plan my high school well, and I was a mediocre student (still performing well objectively, but subjectively I feel I could done a lot better if I think more clearly about what mattered to me and have more discipline). Otherwise, I would at least get some exposure to programming languages and learn some computer sciences early on, so things would be more intuitive for me. However, the reality is that right now I consciously try very hard to improve, both in CS and in Math. Sometimes I feel frustrated with myself over debugging some should-be-straight-forward code, and sometimes I feel embarrassed because it's actually straight forward, it's just I didn't do it right by reading documentation first, and I didn't sleep enough so I am introducing bugs into my code. Nevertheless, I feel that I had put in the work this semester, and I think I am doing well in this class."
