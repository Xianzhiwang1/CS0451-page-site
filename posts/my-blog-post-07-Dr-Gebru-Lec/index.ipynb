    "Dr. Timnit Gebru is scheduled to give a talk at Middlebury College on April 24th at 7:00 PM ET in Hillcrest 103, titled \"Eugenics and the Promise of Utopia through Artificial General Intelligence.\" I am interested in learning more about her field of study and what she would like to address during the talk. Dr. Gebru is a high-achieving academic working broadly in the field of computer vision. She holds a PhD in Computer Science from Stanford, and she is very active in academia and industry alike. "
